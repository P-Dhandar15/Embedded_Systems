# SMART TRAFFIC & STREET LIGHT PROJECT.

**implemented on LPC2148 Microcontroller, a program written in Embedded C language.**

***-> 4 Motion sensors are used to sense the incoming vehicle and the Traffic Light is controlled according to the incoming vehicle from either side.
    Also, the LDR sensor is used to turn the street light automatically on as soon as the darkness falls.

The project is implemented in Keil uVision 5 and the circuit is built on Proteus 8.***
